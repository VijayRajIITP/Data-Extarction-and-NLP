# Data-Extarction-and-NLP
Objective  : The objective of this assignment is to extract textual data articles from the given URL and perform text analysis to compute variables that are explained below. 
# Step1:	Data Extraction
 Extraction of the article text using USE BEATIFULSOUP and SELENIUM library  and save the extracted article in a text file with URL_ID as its file name.
# Step2:  3	Data Analysis
For each of the extracted texts from the article, perform textual analysis and compute variables, given in the output structure excel file. 
We need to save the output in the exact order as given in the output structure file, “Output Data Structure.xlsx”
# Step 3 : Feature Engineering
The script extracts input variables from "Input.xlsx" and computes various linguistic features, including sentiment scores, sentence statistics, and word characteristics, presenting the results in the specified format detailed in "Output Data Structure.xlsx."
